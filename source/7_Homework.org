* Homework Tasks

:END:
** 1. Sense It
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: research
:END:
- The drawer alarm uses a LDR as a sensor to detect when the drawer is open. 
- Research *three* other types of sensor that could be added to a circuit, and suggest a project they could be used for. 
- For each, find a picture from the web of the sensor.
- E.g. An ultrasonic distance sensor uses ultrasound to detect how far away objects are from it. 
- This could be used to make a reversing sensor for a car.
- Upload your work to the first badge in the homework section.

** 2. Sound It
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: document
:END:
- The drawer alarm uses a small loudspeaker to alert the owner when it is triggered. 
- Read this page: https://www.bournetoinvent.com/projects/mp3/step_4.html and complete the task described at the bottom.

** 3. House It
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: design
:END:
- The housing for the drawer alarm is made from laser-cut 3mm acrylic sheet, separated by some nuts and bolts. 
- Sketch designs for two different housings and label them. 
- They’ll still need to have the switch on the front, somewhere for the LDR and two LEDs, but how you design it is up to you. Indicate approximate dimensions. 
- Where will the PCB go? What holds it together? What’s it made from? Where do the batteries go?
